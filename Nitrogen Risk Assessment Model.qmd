                   present in soils, plants, drinking water, and the air. It also functions as a crucial 
                   building block of DNA as nitrogen is key for the synthesis of amino acids and 
                   proteins, which promotes plant growth and contributes to the production of the food we 
                   grow and eat [1, 3]. But as with everything, balance is key! 
                   Not enough nitrogen can result in low crop 
                   yields and stunted plant growth, while too much can be harmful and toxic to both 
                   plants and the environment [1]. The cycling of nitrogen through ecosystems is pivotal for sustaining productive and 
                   healthy environments, ensuring the appropriate nitrogen balance [1].",
